            <h1>Have a Look on Our History </h1>
            <p>MIST Einthoven Club was established in 2017 by the students of the Department of Biomedical 
                Engineering (BME) of Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST).</p>
    
                <p>The name “Einthoven” has evolved from an inverted imaginary equilateral triangle formed by three 
                limb leads placed in a trigonal shape, used in electrocardiography. It is formed by two shoulder 
                and pubis with the heart at the center and has been named after Willem Einthoven.</p>
                
            <p>MIST Einthoven Club consists of a group of enthusiasts, who are eager to work collectively 
                in the biomedical field, to develop ground-breaking solutions to the modern problems in the 
                health sector of Bangladesh. With this agenda in mind, the club has time and again arranged 
                many seminars to facilitate knowledge sharing and detailed discussion about challenges faced 
                by the patients and the operators in the hospitals and other organizations. Our club members 
                are willing to implement their understandings and capabilities to strengthen the nation’s health sector.</p>

            <h1>Our Club Activities</h1>
            <p>We aim for our club activities to cover different aspects related to application of Engineering Principles
                 in Medical Science. Currently our members are working on different such aspects which allows them to
                  both learn and apply their knowledge and intelligence on Engineering challenges relating to Medical
                   Science. Some examples of the subjects on which we worked/are currently working on are given below.</p>
